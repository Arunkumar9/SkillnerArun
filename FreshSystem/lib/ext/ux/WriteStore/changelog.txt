of: their full name; their email address; their forum login.

1.1B1:
- when using 'new' as a key to a key/value pair in an object, some interpreters (IE, perhaps?) will not accept 
  it unless explicitly wrapped in quotes. This was a problem with WriteRecord and usage in WriteStore.
- when listing objects, if the last key/value pair contains an extra comma (,), some interpreters (IE, perhaps?) will not
  accept it; you must explicitly get rid of the extra comma. Problem in WriteStore at the very end.
- Ensure that options are a valid object before setting properties.
- Ensure that lists of object properties do not end in comma in sample.

1.1alpha:
- options for writing: writeMode property is one of replace, update, condensed. Johughes, cimperia
- options to commitChanges, options.mode is one of replace, update, condensed. Johughes, cimperia
- send meta data back to the server, the metadata originally sent from the server, if provided. Frank Mueller
- have failure event if anything fails, either the send (before write event), or if any write event fails. Nalfein
- submit records' id, if the id field was set in the reader metadata. Johughes. 

1.0RC5:
- bug in calling Ext.data.Store.superclass rather than Ext.ux.WriteStore.superclass (occurs twice). Nalfein
- create single this.superclass reference within each class

1.0RC4:
- Make sure WriteStore relays the updateexception event from the updateProxy. chriswa
- add boolean isDirty() to determine if a commit or rollback is needed. Blackhand
- add integer getModifiedCount() to list how many actions (i.e. journal size) will be done on next commit or rollback. Cimperia
- Include WriteRecord to decorate the standard Ext.data.Record
- Allow for rejectChanges of a specific number of changes or all changes

1.0RC3:
- Causes component error if update a record then delete same record then commit, all in one transaction. chriswa
- use addEvents to add new events. pic_Nick

1.0RC2:
- include sample-data.json with distribution. mjlecomte 

1.0RC1:
- include versionizing in the zip distribution file name
- Moved all assumptions about success or failure of write to event handler. GraemeBryce, marte, lostAtSea, cimperia
- Created three events on write - write, writeexception, commit. writeexception is for network failure,
  write is network success but before internal commit. If any handler returns false, the internal commit
  is not performed.
- ObjectReader able to move down into the object to start its root at an arbitrary place, rather than just the
  root of the object. GraemeBryce 

0.5:
- pass commit and/or rollback to Store superclass. pic_Nick

0.4:
- fixed error in callback. tofsteel
